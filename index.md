## Chat
Chat is the primary interface for interacting with uploaded data tables and Quill's pre-processed quantitative data. The pre-processed data includes prices and various numerical ratios for all stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, as well as numerical line item data from SEC 10-K and 10-Q filings. 

To start a chat session, click the yellow '+' icon and select a dataset using the dropdown menu. Any datasets you have uploaded in the data tab will appear as options here, in addition to the pre-processed datasets.
